## Dealing with Outliers

An **outlier** is a value that is significantly higher or lower than most of the other data points in a dataset.  
Outliers can **distort averages, correlations, and model performance**, so detecting and handling them is an essential step in data cleaning.

### Identifying Outliers

You can detect outliers using **visualizations** or **statistical methods**.  
Common tools include **Histograms**, **Boxplots**, and **Standard Deviation**.

| Method | Tool | Description | Example |
|---------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Histogram** | `seaborn.histplot()` | Visualizes data distribution and highlights unusual values | `sns.histplot(df['Sales'])` |
| **Boxplot** | `seaborn.boxplot()` | Displays quartiles and plots outliers as dots outside the whiskers | `sns.boxplot(x=df['Grade'])` |
| **Standard Deviation** | `numpy`, `pandas` | Identifies data points far from the mean (commonly ±3σ) | See code below |

---

### Using Standard Deviation to Detect Outliers

Outliers are often defined as points that are more than **3 standard deviations** away from the mean (for normally distributed data).

```python
import numpy as np

mean = df['Grade'].mean()
std = df['Grade'].std()

# Identify outliers
outliers = df[(df['Grade'] > mean + 3*std) | (df['Grade'] < mean - 3*std)]
```
Adjust the threshold (e.g., 2 or 4) based on the data distribution and domain knowledge.

### Handling  Outliers
| Approach         | Description                                                       | Example                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keep**         | Retain outliers if they’re valid (e.g., extreme but real cases)   | —                                                                      |
| **Remove**       | Drop rows containing outliers                                     | `df = df[(df['Grade'] < mean + 3*std) & (df['Grade'] > mean - 3*std)]` |
| **Impute**       | Replace outliers with NaN or a typical value (mean, median, mode) | `df.loc[df['Grade'] > mean + 3*std, 'Grade'] = np.nan`                 |
| **Domain-based** | Adjust based on expert knowledge or logical limits                | e.g., limit “Age” to between 0 and 120                                 |

### Visualization Libraries
 
| Library        | Use Case                  | Example                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Matplotlib** | General plotting          | `plt.hist(df['Grade'])`      |
| **Seaborn**    | Statistical visualization | `sns.boxplot(x=df['Grade'])` |
 
```python
# Always visualize your data before and after removing outliers to confirm their impact on the distribution. 
sns.boxplot(x=df['Grade'])
```
